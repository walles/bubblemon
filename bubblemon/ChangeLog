2008-12-28  Johan Walles  <johan.walles@gmail.com>

	* Enforce a minimum water level to make CPU load bubbles visible
	even on systems with lots of free RAM.

	* Build 2.0.10.

2008-12-26  Johan Walles  <johan.walles@gmail.com>

	changes, courtesy of Jose Carlos Medeiros.

2008-01-05  Johan Walles  <johan.walles@gmail.com>

	* Use ioctls for listing interfaces rather than polling for a list
	of known interface names.  Should close Debian bug 158667.

	* Change phrasing in some places to match that of other GNOME
	applets.

2007-09-02  Johan Walles  <johan.walles@gmail.com>

	* Change default installation prefix to /usr since many GNOME
	installs aren't aware of the existence of /usr/local.

	* Change GNOME category to System & Hardware since the Utility
	category used previously seems deprecated.

2007-08-26  Johan Walles  <johan.walles@gmail.com>

	* Fix SMP detection code.  Has been broken since dackefejden.

	* Give each CPU some space of its own on the bubble display.  The
	CPU with the heaviest load gets to bubble in the middle.  CPUs
	with lower load bubbles nearer to the edges.  The idea is to make
	it possible to see not only how loaded the system is, but also how
	the load is distributed between different CPUs.

	* Released 2.0.6

	* Update the Polish translation, courtesy of Tomasz Dominikowski.
