bubblemon-gnome2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This GNOME applet displays the system load in the form of a bubbling
liquid.  The surface level corresponds to the amount of memory used by
the system; a high surface level means that lots of memory is in use.
The amount of bubbles indicates the system load; lots of bubbles means
a high system load.  The color of the liquid indicates the amount of
swap space used.  As long as the liquid is water colored no swap is
being used, but as more swap is used the liquid turns redder.  A
message in a bottle indicates that there is unread mail in the file
pointed out by the $MAIL environment variable.  Seaweeds / reed
growing up from the bottom indicate IO load; high weeds equals high
load.
.LP
If you want exact figures, there is a tooltip that pops up if you
hover your mouse pointer over the applet for a second.
