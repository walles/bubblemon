{"name":"Bubblemon","tagline":"Widget visualizing system load as a bubbling liquid","body":"The Bubbling Load Monitor (or \"Bubblemon\" for short) is a system load monitor. It displays something that looks like a vial containing water:\r\n\r\n![OS X Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walles/bubblemon/master/pixmaps/screenshot-osx.png)\r\n\r\nThe **water level** indicates how much memory is in use.\r\n\r\nThe system CPU load is indicated by **bubbles** floating up through the liquid; lots of bubbles means high CPU load. The most heavily loaded CPU will bubble in the middle, and less loaded CPUs nearer the edges. So a column of bubbles in the middle means that a single CPU is doing all the work, but bubbles across the full width means all CPUs are busy.\r\n\r\nThe **color of the liquid** indicates how much swap space is used (watery blue means none and angry red means all).\r\n\r\nIO / hard disk load is indicated by **green seaweed growing from the bottom**.\r\n\r\nOn some platforms, a **message in a bottle** falls into the water if you have unread mail.\r\n\r\nA screenshot doesn't do the applet much justice, since part of its coolness is its physics engine, making the bubbles move, the surface ripple and water to flow. So [**check it out**](https://github.com/walles/bubblemon) for yourself!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
