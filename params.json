  "body": "The Bubbling Load Monitor (or \"Bubblemon\" for short) is a system load monitor. It displays something that looks like a vial containing water:\r\n\r\n![OS X Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walles/bubblemon/master/pixmaps/screenshot-osx.png)\r\n\r\nThe **water level** indicates how much memory is in use.\r\n\r\nThe system CPU load is indicated by **bubbles** floating up through the liquid; lots of bubbles means high CPU load. The most heavily loaded CPU will bubble in the middle, and less loaded CPUs nearer the edges. So a column of bubbles in the middle means that a single CPU is doing all the work, but bubbles across the full width means all CPUs are busy.\r\n\r\nThe **color of the liquid** indicates how much swap space is used (watery blue means none and angry red means all).\r\n\r\nIO / hard disk load is indicated by **green seaweed growing from the bottom**.\r\n\r\nOn some platforms, a **message in a bottle** falls into the water if you have unread mail.\r\n\r\n# Installing\r\nA screenshot doesn't do the applet much justice, since part of its coolness is its physics engine, making the bubbles move, the surface ripple and water to flow. So [check it out for yourself](https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases)!\r\n* Download the latest release: [Click here](https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases)\r\n* Click on the zip file to unzip it\r\n* In Finder, double click the `bubblemon-osx-<version>` folder to open it\r\n* Right click `Bubblemon` in that folder and choose Open\r\n* Bubblemon should now restart your Dock and start doing its thing\r\n* Right click Bubblemon for help\r\n* Left click Bubblemon to launch Activity Monitor",
