The Bubbling Load Monitor (or "Bubblemon" for short) is a system load
meter originally developed for the GNOME panel. It looks like a vial
containing water. The water level indicates how much (electronic)
memory is in use. The color of the liquid indicates how much swap
space is used. The amount of bubbles reflects the system CPU load. A
message in a bottle indicates there is unread mail. A reed-like graph
shows IO load.

On SMP systems CPU load distribution is visualized by having the most
heavily loaded CPUs bubbles in the middle and the others nearer to the
edges.
